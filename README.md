# TheGuessingGame.py
The project begins by asking that you pick a number of your choice between 1 and 100. After you have chosen a number the program generates its answer to suggest if you should guess lower or higher. You continue guessing based off of the programs responses, and eventually you will have solved the guessing game and it will congratulate you on your victory.
# Momentum.py
You first must decide how much the mass is for your object. Next, you must decide on the velocity that your object is going. Then the program will respond with the momentum from the two numbers you put into the system.
